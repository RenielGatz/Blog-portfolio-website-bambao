                    <p> On day 3 of demo teaching (week 7) in Home Economics, I may have felt a little bored because some of the topics were repetitive. However, I learned a lot about how to construct an effective lesson plan that connects the lesson properly with the main objectives of the lesson and executes it in the proper way.

                 As a future educator, I should always be on time to be a good role model for students, and in some cases, I need to show empathy and patience when I teach because every student is different. I am fascinated to be an instructor for tech-voc students, but I also think about the responsibility of having solid knowledge about the lesson, creating effective presentations, and providing experiential learning opportunities for my students. As a teacher, I believe that having a wide range of vocabulary is essential when conveying concepts of a certain topic.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  In conclusion, to be the best educator, it takes effort and time to prepare before teaching the whole topic in the lesson plan. Consistent effort in creating lesson plans and learning materials will be the most valuable thing a teacher can do.
